# Running the server

We included several RESTful server that each implement the same endpoints and logic. 
Pick the language you are most comfortable in and follow the instructions in the directory on how to run.

# Configuring your .env file
If you want to run the recipe locally, copy the .env.example file to your own .env file in this directory: 

```
cp .env.example .env
```

You will need a Stripe account with its own set of [API keys](https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys).
