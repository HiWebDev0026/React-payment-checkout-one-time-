# Contributing to this Checkout sample

Thanks for contributing to this sample!

## Issues

This sample shows you how to integrate with [Stripe Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout). Please only file issues here that you believe represent bugs with this particular sample, not Stripe Checkout or the [Stripe CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) itself.

If you're having general trouble with Checkout, please reach out to us using the form at <https://support.stripe.com/email>, or come chat with us on the [Stripe Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/rujnsbxrqn). We're very proud of our level of service, and we're more than happy to help you out with your integration.

If you've found a bug in any of the implementations in this repository, please [let us know](https://github.com/stripe-samples/checkout-one-time-payments/issues/new)!

## Code review

All pull requests will be reviewed by someone from Stripe before merging. At
Stripe, we believe that code review is for explaining and having a discussion
around code. For those new to code review, we strongly recommend [this
video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pjjmw9trb7s) on "code review culture."

## Developing

This sample includes 8 server implementations so, to run locally, follow the steps indicated in the [main README.md](README.md#how-to-run-locally), followed with the instructions in the README of the server implemtation of your choice.
