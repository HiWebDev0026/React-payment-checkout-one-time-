# Using Checkout for one-time purchases
Building payment form UI from scratch is difficult -- input field validation, error message handing, and localization are just a few things to think about when designing a simple checkout flow.

We built [Checkout](https://stripe.com/docs/payments/checkout) to do that work for you so now you can focus on building the best storefront experience for your customers.

Once your customer is ready to pay, use Stripe.js to redirect them to the URL of your Stripe hosted payment page. It's so simple you don't even need a server! ü•≥

**Demo**

See the sample [live](https://0hczv.sse.codesandbox.io/) or [fork](https://codesandbox.io/s/stripe-sample-checkout-one-time-payments-0hczv) on CodeSandbox.

The demo is running in test mode -- use `4242424242424242` as a test card number with any CVC + future expiration date.

Use the `4000000000003220` test card number to trigger a 3D Secure challenge flow.

## How to run locally

There are two integrations: `client-only` and `client-and-server`. The following are instructions on how to run the `client-and-server` integration: 

This sample includes 5 server implementations in Node, Ruby, Python, Java, and PHP.

Follow the steps below to run locally.

**1. Clone the repository:**

```
git clone https://github.com/stripe-samples/checkout-one-time-payments
```

**2. Copy the .env.example to a .env file:**
Copy the .env.example file into a file named .env in the folder of the server you want to use. For example:

```
cp .env.example client-and-server/server/node/.env
```

You will need a Stripe account in order to run the demo. Once you set up your account, go to the Stripe [developer dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/development#api-keys) to find your API keys and update your .env file with the keys.

```
STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=<replace-with-your-publishable-key>
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=<replace-with-your-secret-key>
```

The other environment variables are configurable:

`STATIC_DIR` tells the server where to the client files are located and does not need to be modified unless you move the server files.

`BASE_PRICE` is the amount for the order.

`CURRENCY` is the currency for the order.

`DOMAIN` is the domain of your website, where Checkout will redirect back to after the customer completes the payment on the Checkout page. 

**3. Follow the server instructions on how to run:**

Pick the server language you want and follow the instructions in the server folder README on how to run.

For example, if you want to run the Node server:

```
cd client-and-server/server/node # there's a README in this folder with instructions
npm install
npm start
```

**4. [Optional] Run a webhook locally:**

You can use the Stripe CLI to easily spin up a local webhook.

First [install the CLI](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli) and [link your Stripe account](https://stripe.com/docs/stripe-cli#link-account).

```
stripe listen --forward-to localhost:4242/webhook
```

The CLI will print a webhook secret key to the console. Set `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` to this value in your .env file.

You should see events logged in the console where the CLI is running.

When you are ready to create a live webhook endpoint, follow our guide in the docs on [configuring a webhook endpoint in the dashboard](https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/setup#configure-webhook-settings). 


## FAQ
Q: Why did you pick these frameworks?

A: We chose the most minimal framework to convey the key Stripe calls and concepts you need to understand. These demos are meant as an educational tool that helps you roadmap how to integrate Stripe within your own system independent of the framework.

Q: Can you show me how to build X?

A: We are always looking for new sample ideas, please email dev-samples@stripe.com with your suggestion!
